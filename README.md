TRAVELLING SALESMAN 
Overview
A mini-project on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that explores algorithmic techniques to find the shortest route visiting all cities and returning to the start. Includes performance analysis for different approaches.

Features
Brute Force: Finds exact solutions by exploring all permutations.
Greedy Algorithm: Approximates solutions using a nearest-neighbor heuristic.
Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp): Optimized approach for better efficiency.
Technologies
Languages: Python, C++, or Java
Input: Distance matrix or city coordinates
Usage
Clone the repository.
Run the program:
Python: python tsp.py
C++: g++ tsp.cpp -o tsp && ./tsp
Input city data and view the shortest route and distance.
Applications
Route optimization
Logistics and supply chains
